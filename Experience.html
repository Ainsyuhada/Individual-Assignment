<h2>Teenager's Life</h2>
	<pre> 2018 :
	 1. School Attack Program.
	
	When I got to the school, the students greeted me and my friends very kindly.
	They have great respect for all of us. They are also friendly because since our arrival,they have not stopped talking at all. 
	My friends and I were so amused by their chatter. At first, they were a bit shy but eventually they became comfortable with us.
	During the activity, they had time to invite me and my friends to take a selfie.
	However, the program we conducted at the school was only half a day and caused them to be 
	dissatisfied because our arrival was only temporary. Before we went home, they told us to come visit them again here.

	 <pre> 2019 :
	 1. Let's Zoom Out Program.
	 	
	This program is held on a large scale where it involves among other Universities.
	This program aims to increase knowledge about MCMC as well as to strengthen the relationship between these students.
	This program is only held for 2 days where students from other universities can stay at the Uitm Kelantan branch college residence.
	Their presence makes us very happy because they are not arrogant and like to give us new knowledge.
